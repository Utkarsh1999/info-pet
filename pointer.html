                <div class="panel-body"><p>A pointing breed is a type of gundog typically used in finding game. Gundogs are traditionally divided into three classes: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds. The name pointer comes from the dog's instinct to point, by stopping and aiming its muzzle towards game. This demonstrates to the hunter the location of his or her quarry and allows them to move into gun range. Pointers were selectively bred from dogs who had abundant pointing and backing instinct. They typically start to acquire their hunting instincts at about 2 months of age.</p>
                <h3>Size:</h3><p>Males stand 25 to 28 inches at the shoulder and weigh 55 to 75 pounds; females 23 to 26 inches and 45 to 65 pounds.</p>
                <h3>Personality:</h3><p>Devoted and even-tempered, the Pointer is described as a congenial companion. He has a competitive spirit and an independent streak, but he's also fun-loving and mischievous. An excellent watchdog, he's protective of his property and will sound the alarm at anything out of the ordinary. In the field, he's hard-driving and courageous. In obedience trials he's willing and exuberant, performing the "come" command — known as the recall in the ring — as if shot out of a cannon.Pointers need early socialization and training. Like any dog, they can become timid if they are not properly socialized — exposed to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Pointer puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Pointers work well with people, but because of their hunting heritage — which often involves them working well away from the hunter — they can be independent, with a mind of their own. Pointers want to understand why you're asking them to do something and determine if it's a reasonable request before acting on any command. Train them with kindness and consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The Pointer who's treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. Pointers will develop selective hearing if there's something more exciting to pay attention to.</p>
                <h3>Health:</h3><p>Pointers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pointers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.</p>
                <h3>Coat Color And Grooming:</h3><p>An old hunters' saying is that a good Pointer can't be a bad color. The Pointer has a striking coat of liver (dark brown), black, orange, or lemon, with or without a white background. Some Pointers have light or heavy speckles — called ticking — on the white areas of their coat. Tricolor Pointers (white, plus two other colors) exist but aren't very common. Dark-colored Pointers have a black or brown nose; light-colored dogs have a light or flesh-colored nose.The coat itself is short, smooth, and shiny. Give him a thorough brushing once a week with a hound mitt — a nubbly glove that fits over your hand — and he's good to go. He sheds only lightly, and the regular brushing will help keep hair off your clothes and furniture. Rub him with a chamois and his coat will gleam.In most cases, regular brushing and an occasional wipe down with a damp cloth or baby wipe will keep your Pointer clean, but he might need a bath three or four times a year. Use a shampoo made for dogs to keep the coat and skin from becoming dry, and be sure to rinse thoroughly to prevent itchiness from shampoo residue.Begin accustoming your Pointer to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.</p>

                <div class="panel-body"><p>Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Pointer's physique sleek by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. Giving him plenty of daily exercise should do the rest. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine and the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs. If you can't feel the ribs, he needs a little less food and a lot more exercise.</p>
