                <div class="panel-body"><p>The Siberian Husky is a medium size working dog breed that originated in north-eastern Siberia, Russia.The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings.The original Siberian Huskies were bred by the Chukchi people — whose hunter-gatherer culture relied on their help. It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs. The people of Nome referred to the Siberian Huskies as "Siberian Rats" due to size and weighing 40 to 50 pounds when compared to the Malamute dogs.</p>
                <h3>Size:</h3><p>An average male stands between 21 and 23.5 inches high while the female averages 20 to 22 inches. The male weighs between 45 and 60 pounds and the female 35 to 50 pounds.</p>
                <h3>Personality:</h3><p>Siberian Huskies are pack dogs, and they need an owner who is the clear leader of the pack. This makes training easier because you will find that your dog respects you, but don't be surprised if he tests the limits of your position in the pack and tries to take control from time to time.When this happens, it's important not to give into their pushiness. Assert yourself as leader — not by bullying or hitting — but by confirming the ground rules with clarity and consistency.Making your dog wait to eat is one of the best ways to establish your leadership role. The Husky will view you as the keeper of all valuable resources — food, treats, toys and other canine assets.This high-energy breed can be destructive both indoors and out — especially when bored or not given adequate exercise. They will demolish a house if they are left alone and there has even been a case of a Siberian Husky chewing through a cement wall.</p>
                <h3>Health:</h3><p>Huskies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Huskies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.</p>
                <h3>Coat Color And Grooming:</h3><p>Make sure your vacuum cleaner is in top working order and you book time regularly to groom if you adopt a Siberian Husky. His double coat features medium-length hair. The top coat is straight and the undercoat feels soft and dense.Expect lots of hair, lots of shedding — especially during spring and fall when they blow their coats. That said, this is a fairly easy breed to care for. Siberian Huskies living in cooler temperatures tend to shed less than those who live in warmer climates. You can avoid matting — and excess hair on your furniture — if you commit to brushing your dog's coat at least once a week during the year — and daily during shedding season.Siberian Huskies are clean dogs and will take the time to clean themselves — much like a cat will. They don't typically emit "doggy" odor and rarely need baths. Unless, of course, they wiggle in something disgusting in the backyard or find a stinky body of water to jump in. When it is bath time, select a high-quality dog shampoo designed to keep the natural oils in your dog's skin and coat.Huskies come in a variety of colors and markings, from black to pure white with colored markings on the body that include reds and coppers. Their eyes can be brown, blue, or a combination. Their faces sport masks that add to their eye appeal.</p>

                <div class="panel-body"><p>Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.When it comes to meal times, Siberian Huskies are known for being "easy keepers" — requiring a relatively small amount of food for their size. This trait may be traced to the origins of the breed, as the Chukchis developed these dogs to pull a light load at a fast pace over great distances in low temperatures on the smallest possible intake of food. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.</p>
